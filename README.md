Welcome to my Git repository of MongoDBDemo for a holiday listing application simlar to AIRBNB, it is just aa start and you can improvize further.

This applicaiton in hosted on Heroku.  the url to access this site is https://mongodbholidayhomelisting.herokuapp.com/

I have used Code Institute student template for Gitpod. That has preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. 

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

Happy coding!
